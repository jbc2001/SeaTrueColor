## Overview
This is a simple web app to correct the colors of underwater images and reveal their true colors.
It provides a live view of the image so you can fine tune the slider.

## Limitations
- This app is only designed to correct the subject in focus. For wider or deeper shots this tool cannot accurately correct the entire image
- The depth slider also needs to include the distance to the subject. For close up images this may be negligable but zoomed in shots will need to account for this

## Potential Improvements
- UI overhaul
- Lower Resolution for live view
- Correction for wider shots (unlikely for this simple tool)
